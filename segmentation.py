# This tutorial focuses on the task of image segmentation, using a modified [U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).
# 
# ## What is image segmentation?
# So far you have seen image classification, where the task of the network is to assign a label or class to an input image. However, suppose you want to know where an object is located in the image, the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. In this case you will want to segment the image, i.e., each pixel of the image is given a label. Thus, the task of image segmentation is to train a neural network to output a pixel-wise mask of the image. This helps in understanding the image at a much lower level, i.e., the pixel level. Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging to name a few.
# 
# The dataset that will be used for this tutorial is the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/), created by Parkhi *et al*. The dataset consists of images, their corresponding labels, and pixel-wise masks. The masks are basically labels for each pixel. Each pixel is given one of three categories :
# 
# *   Class 1 : Pixel belonging to the pet.
# *   Class 2 : Pixel bordering the pet.
# *   Class 3 : None of the above/ Surrounding pixel.

# ## Define the model
# The model being used here is a modified U-Net. A U-Net consists of an encoder (downsampler) and decoder (upsampler). In-order to learn robust features, and reduce the number of trainable parameters, a pretrained model can be used as the encoder. Thus, the encoder for this task will be a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, whose intermediate outputs will be used, and the decoder will be the upsample block already implemented in TensorFlow Examples in the [Pix2pix tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/tensorflow_examples/models/pix2pix/pix2pix.py). 
# 
# The reason to output three channels is because there are three possible labels for each pixel. Think of this as multi-classification where each pixel is being classified into three classes.

# In[ ]:


OUTPUT_CHANNELS = 3


# As mentioned, the encoder will be a pretrained MobileNetV2 model which is prepared and ready to use in [tf.keras.applications](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications). The encoder consists of specific outputs from intermediate layers in the model. Note that the encoder will not be trained during the training process.

# In[ ]:


base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=[128, 128, 3], include_top=False)

# Use the activations of these layers
layer_names = [
    'block_1_expand_relu',   # 64x64
    'block_3_expand_relu',   # 32x32

    'block_13_expand_relu',  # 8x8
    'block_16_project',      # 4x4

    x = concat([x, skip])

  x = last(x)

  return tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)


# ## Train the model
# Now, all that is left to do is to compile and train the model. The loss being used here is losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy. The reason to use this loss function is because the network is trying to assign each pixel a label, just like multi-class prediction. In the true segmentation mask, each pixel has either a {0,1,2}. The network here is outputting three channels. Essentially, each channel is trying to learn to predict a class, and losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy is the recommended loss for such a scenario. Using the output of the network, the label assigned to the pixel is the channel with the highest value. This is what the create_mask function is doing.

model = unet_model(OUTPUT_CHANNELS)

# ## Next steps
# Now that you have an understanding of what image segmentation is and how it works, you can try this tutorial out with different intermediate layer outputs, or even different pretrained model. You may also challenge yourself by trying out the [Carvana](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/overview) image masking challenge hosted on Kaggle.
# 
# You may also want to see the [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) for another model you can retrain on your own data.
